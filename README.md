# VFEA
Materials for my FISA course on Vibration and Finite Element Analysis (VFEA)

The solutions to all exercices done in class. 

Please check:

Ex0.mlx on SDOF 

Ex1.m on Laplace transform

Ex3.m on state space approach

Ex4.m on Lagrange equations for M,K,C system

Some exercices used Laplace Transform (LT) used to solve the ODE describing the System  to give the displacement x(t) of the mass excited by the input signal y(t). (extracted from "doing physics with matlab")
